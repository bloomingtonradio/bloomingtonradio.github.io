Looking for twenty one radio amateurs to assist with Owen-Putnam State Forest 50/50

The Owen-Putnam State Forest (OPSF) 50/50 has been described as the “toughest  50 mile, 50 Kilometer or 14 mile run in Indiana” with over a 6500 foot elevation gain over 50 miles. 

Over the years amateur radio has played an important role, in the run, assisting the organizers by relaying runner check ins to Start/Finish and Aid Stations. Also reporting any Aid Station needs, such as low supplies, runner assistance (injury and/or runner dropping or changing race selection, such as 50 K to 50 M) and any other critical information. 

The OPSF event began in 1993 when Jeff Tincher designed a multiple loop course, beginning and ending at Rattlesnake Campground in the form of a 50-mile race. Thus, the event logo of the rattlesnake was born, which remains to this day.

The OPSF 50/50  runs through beautiful and rugged Owen-Putnam State Forest and there will be mud! Two years ago, the OPSF 5050 was run in 50 degree dry weather. Last year it was completed during the second worst one day snow total for that date in March! 

The race creates a sense of camaraderie between runners who face the challenge and the runners appreciate our presence. The participants are among the most positive people with whom I have had the pleasure of being involved. This makes for a great day!

Meals are furnished and you will return home with a snazzy shirt!

The event will be held Saturday March 23, 2019.
