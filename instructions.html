<h1>BARC Website Maintenance Instructions</h1>

The BARC website uses the free, web-based Github platform for hosting.  This makes it easy to edit 
content via the web.  Instructions to do so are as follows:

<ol>

<li>Log into Github by going to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and clicking on "Sign In" at the top left. 
   (The username is bloomingtonradio and you can get the password from the BARC President.)</li>

<li>Find the "Your repositories" box on the right and click on the "bloomingtonradio.github.io" link.</li>

<li>You will see listing of files in the repository.  A complete description of
each file is in the file "file-description.html".  You can also go to http://bloomigntonradio.org/&lt;filename&gt; (for example 
   http://bloomingtonradio.org/about.html) to see what it looks like at the front end. Files where changes are most 
   likely to be made are:

<ul>
<li>cal.html: The meeting schedule</li>
<li>meetings.html: The meeting schedule</li>
<li>nco.html: The NCO schedule</li>
<li>news.html: The news that appears on the front page</li>
<li>js/data.html: Calendar events (i.e. in the subfolder "js")</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Click on the file you want to change.</li>

<li>Click on the little pencil sign on top left of the box, to the right "History".</li>

<li>Make the desired change, being careful not to change any of the HTML tags.</li>

<li>Click the green "Commit Changes" button at the bottom.</li>

<li>That's it.  The website will update in a minute or less.  Sometimes it may take a bit
longer, but it's unlikely to be long.</li>

</ol>
